# Hashems-CV
Just finished my very first CV ðŸ“ƒ.

I guess I've reached the point where I'd have to have a CV to show off my skills for future jobs.

And instead of designing it in Adobe Illustrator like a regular human being, I decided for some reason to make it as a website, and literally chose the best logical option out thereâ€¦ Yep, I made it using ReactJS ðŸ¤£.
